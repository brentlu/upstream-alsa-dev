# upstream-alsa-dev
<pre>
It's a simple script to collect maintainers from one or multiple patches and form the git command for upstream.

Prerequisite:
1. put the script in your path
2. go to the root directory of your Linux source tree and generate the patch(es)

If there is only one patch need to upstream:
$ upstream-alsa-dev.py [patch name]<br />
If there are multiple patches:
$ upstream-alsa-dev.py

The script will prepare the cc list for you!
